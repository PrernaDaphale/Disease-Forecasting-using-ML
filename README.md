# Disease Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview
  This project aims to forecast the diseases like heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes using Machine Learning techniques on same platform. 
By leveraging diverse datasets and predictive modeling, this project helps in early detection and prevention efforts. 
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, model testing and accurate predictions.

## Features
- Predictive Modeling: Utilized machine learning algorithms to forecast heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.
- Comprehensive Data Handling: Efficient data preprocessing and management.
- Data Handling: Efficient data management using Python pickling.
- Cross-platform Development: Develop and run the project using Anaconda Navigator and Google Colab.
- Multiple Disease Support: Models for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.
